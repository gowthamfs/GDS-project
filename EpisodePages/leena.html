            A superhero is someone who inspires us, who shows hope when there’s
            none, who makes sure others don’t suffer the same struggle that they
            went through and breaks barriers with all their might. Someone who
            stands up for the injustice against the community, someone who no
            matter how many times they fall, will rise up to fight and give
            their best. That’s exactly what our guest today, Leena Haque has
            been doing.Leena is a Senior UX Designer & Neurodiversity Program
            Lead at BBC. As a neurodivergent individual, she overcame many
            barriers from education to employment and is working towards
            breaking the same barriers for others using innovation and
            creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has made significant contributions to the betterment of the
            neurodiverse community locally, nationally and globally.At a time
            when Neurodiversity was virtually unknown, Leena’s dedication and
            persistence delivered an engaging narrative for change and support.
            Leena co-led BBC's Neurodiversity initiative CAPE (Creating a
            Positive Environment) which she has nurtured and grown from a small,
            temporary project within the Finance department to an
            organization-wide program.Leena is recognized as a key influencer in
            the media and creative sectors, she has received multiple awards for
            her work in BBC CAPE from the National Autistic Society, the
            Business Disability Forum and Creative Diversity Network.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a child, Leena struggled to fit in with her peers. When she was
            old enough to grasp what it meant to be different from her peers,
            she understood that school was not going to be easy for her. She
            felt her future was uncertain because of her learning differences,
            struggling to keep up with the education system and the curriculum.
            But with the support of her family and good teachers, she eventually
            succeeded in school and overcame the hurdles in her education and
            found success in her career.As a neurodiverse individual, Leena has
            always felt she had to work harder than the rest of her colleagues
            and it was difficult for her to be taken seriously because of her
            neurological differences and neurodiversity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The struggle for neurodiverse individuals is not just about finding
            a job that allows them to use their talents but it’s also about
            being taken seriously and truly recognized for their skillset.Though
            it was a journey of many ups and downs, she understood herself
            better, how to manage her time better, what her strengths are and
            the areas she found challenging. During this journey, Leena made a
            promise to herself that others would not face the same struggles and
            barriers that she faced in education or career.
          </p>
          <p>
            how no child or young person regardless of their abilities should go
            through the feeling that their future is uncertain. She is striving
            to make sure every child feels happy and has a safe future.Success
            is not a linear path, you will have many successes and failures as
            you progress in your life. Leena shares how while her career growth
            has been good due to the understanding and support from her
            co-workers and senior leaders, she still has a long way to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            People tend to think that because Leena is at BBC, she was
            successful but that’s not the truth. Leena shares how there are
            still struggles and barriers she faces and she continues to put in
            hard work and have conversations to make sure the environment is
            accessible and all are treated fairly.Leena is open about her
            failure because not many people are, as there’s a stigma to talking
            about rejection and failure. Just recently she was not successful in
            an assessment for leadership growth.

          <p>
            She hopes people will understand that rejection is a part of life
            and others will be able to relate to her, and realize that they are
            not alone or that it might not even be their fault as sometimes the
            system is designed to fail people who are different.This recent
            rejection was hard for Leena. She felt like she had let her family
            and colleagues down. Momentarily she even felt like giving up and
            thought she might never make it but that did not stop her. She
            picked herself up, told that there is new hope, new light in the
            darkness and kept going.
          </p>
          <p>
            On asking what motivates Leena to keep fighting against these
            barriers, she shared how kindness and helping others motivates
            her.Most organizations don't realize that they are creating barriers
            for people. It takes people like Leena to bring it to their
            attention that there is a barrier and it’s preventing someone from
            growing. For neurodiversity to thrive, organizations need to create
            a safe place for neurodiverse individuals where they can share their
            concerns, thoughts and be able to flourish in the workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most systems and processes are designed for the neurotypical mind
            and they are filtering out neurodivergent thinkers and talent. To
            prevent losing people right at that start, a real review has to take
            place.In Leena’s case, the recent assessment consisted of vague
            tasks and methods using psychometric tests, role-plays, and
            situational judgment tests. Anyone who is neurodivergent will
            understand that these methods can be challenging and are not
            designed for the neurodivergent mind but rather for the neurotypical
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, these types of assessments are subjective and may not give
            an accurate picture of what people will do in real life.Every
            superhero needs a team to support them. With the help of her
            brilliant line manager Sean, who is also the co-lead of the BBC CAPE
            initiative with her, Leena has been able to find ways to contribute
            to the organization, grow as a person and professionally. Leena sees
            failure as a foundation to build from. We might end up feeling empty
            at that moment but Leena tells us how just like every house is built
            from an empty piece of land, we too can build from this experience.
