              In our third episode of Global Dialogue Series on Neurodiversity,
              we speak with Andrew Eddy. Andrew Eddy is the CEO of Untapped, a
              social enterprise focused on developing a sustainable neurodiverse
              employment ecosystem to increase opportunities for autistic
              individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Andrew is on a mission to change the narrative about autism
              through awareness, education and engagement. Andrew leads the
              Neurodiversity Hub initiative, which collaborates with
              universities, colleges, employers and service providers to work
              together to create environments and opportunities for
              neurodivergent young adults to succeed.

              There’s a growing interest towards neurodiversity and the
              recognition that diverse talents make companies more innovative.
              One of the most untapped talents is neurodiversity and at least
              one in ten people are neurodivergent.
            </p>
            <p>
              More than ever, it’s crucial for companies to assess their
              workplace for sensory issues, make sure their jobs are
              appropriately designed and to provide resource groups and
              awareness training about neurodiversity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even within the organization, there are many neurodiverse
              individuals who might not identify themselves or share their
              concerns Andrew tells us that the best way to solve this is by
              implementing programs that can support neurodiverse individuals.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              More than policies, support programs help to bring out better
              integration as it’s not just words anymore but action. Andrew has
              seen huge impacts with the companies that he has worked with when
              such programs were implemented and how it brought more people
              together to support and embrace neurodiversity. Hiring
              neurodiverse individuals can be a challenge with the existing
              hiring models. 
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the things that I completely agree with
              Andrew is using learning as continuous assessment to hire
              neurodiverse talents. That’s something that we also do in
              HashHackCode for neurodivergent tech talents. Andrew shares with
              us how when hiring neurodiverse individuals, it’s important not to
              look at job descriptions but rather their traits and how this can
              be achieved through assessment workshops.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              The bootcamps that can
              help identify the potential of the neurodiverse candidate. He also
              tells us that neurodiversity should not be seen purely as an HR
              initiative, but rather as a part of the company's capabilities.
              
              
            </p>
            <p>
              This will help to integrate neurodivergent talents into the
              workforce much more easily as the requirement is coming from the
              people who are going to work with them and they will be able to
              better see their growth and nurture their talent.
               
            </p>
            <p>
              This aspect is really important because when it comes to the
              growth of neurodiverse individuals in a company, there hasn’t been
              much done and that is something we have to really change. Most
              neurodiverse individuals are only given a job, there’s no
              recognition after that.
              
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              Within the company, there should be
              programs that help neurodiverse individuals not only get a job but
              identify and understand their strengths, build on those strengths,
              look for other opportunities in the company and advocate for
              themselves.              
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the best places to start for neurodiversity is to build
              employee resource groups, which can help transform the narrative
              by changing the conversation and creating more awareness
              A good tip from Andrew was to take part in various summits and
              webinars on neurodiversity and encourage people to watch and use
              it as a base to develop discussions.

          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              Andrews adds how during this pandemic period, we have all had
              difficult times and mental health has become very important,
              especially for neurodiverse individuals whose challenges are even
              more magnified, the support and understanding of managers and
              co-workers is essential for neurodiverse individuals.
              It can vary
              from technical to life skills to mental health.
              Andrew and his team have created some great resources that can
              help companies to integrate neurodiversity, make universities more
              accessible to neurodiverse individuals and help neurodiverse
              individuals succeed.
