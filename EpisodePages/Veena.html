              In our sixth episode of Global Dialogue Series on Neurodiversity, we
            speak with Veena Naren, a special educator since 1996 and a parent
            of a 21 years old neurodiverse individual. Veena has been a strong
            advocate for building awareness about Fragile X syndrome in India
            and breaking the gender bias for mothers of neurodiverse children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Veena has helped many parents by sharing her own experience of
            raising her son Varun with a positive attitude and bringing out his
            capabilities to become a self-reliant and contributing member of
            society.
            Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that affects a range of
            developmental problems like learning difficulties, behavioral
            challenges and health.
            </p>

            <p>
              Nearly 200,000 to 400,000 children in India
            are affected by Fragile X syndrome, but most remain undiagnosed,
            even though diagnoses just require a simple DNA blood test.Fragile
            X syndrome is often misdiagnosed as autism, even for Veena’s son
            Varun, who was earlier diagnosed with autism, only at age of 11,
            they came to know that he had Fragile X syndrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              While there are children with both autism and Fragile X syndrome,
            Veena and her family have been working together to build awareness
            about Fragile X syndrome in India and encouraging parents to
            diagnose for Fragile X syndrome even if the child was earlier
            diagnosed with autism.
              As Fragile X syndrome can also affect the
            parents with premutation condition in older age, who can develop
            seizures similar to Parkinson’s disease.

          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              One of the primary reasons that Fragile X syndrome in India still
            remains undiagnosed is because it’s a genetic condition, it becomes
            a taboo for a lot of parents, especially the mothers, who are most
            often unfairly blamed for their child’s condition. Even as we
            advance as a society, the taboo still remains at large.
            </p>
            <p>
              Veena tells
            us that the society needs to be aware that Fragile X syndrome can be
            passed from both male and female carriers.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a boy is born, he takes the X chromosome of the mother and Y
            chromosome of the father, but when a girl is born, she takes the X
            chromosome from the mother as well as the father,
            if the father is a
            carrier of a Fragile X syndrome, it can be passed down from him.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              Since 2011, after reading an article about Fragile X syndrome that
            helped with Varun's diagnosis, Veena and her husband Naren realized
            that there was much to do on building awareness about Fragile X
            syndrome in India.They funded a doctor to go to the US and get
            trained to better help children with Fragile X syndrome and their
            parents.
            </p>
            <p>
               They also helped to open the first clinic in India for
            Fragile X syndrome.Veena shares how the support of her husband has been immense in this
            journey, where both of them equally took the responsibilities and
            shared the work.But unfortunately, that is not the case at large in
            most households in India, there have been cases where the father
            abandoned the child because of their challenges or just provided
            financial support.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              Families should understand that it’s a collective
            responsibility and not just the mothers, while mothers are resilient
            does not mean they have to handle this on their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every child is greatly influenced by the choices of their parents in
            their early age. In a country like India where academics are given
            so much importance and most children are forced to participate in
            that race and expectations thrust upon them, there’s no exception in
            this whether neurodiverse or neurotypical.
            </p>
            <p>
              Veena strongly believes
            parents should not compare their child with others, each child is
            capable and it’s okay if they are learning at their own pace.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              While many parents’ benchmarks for their child is to complete middle
            or high school, Veena and Naren took a different path for Varun.
            They drifted away from the traditional academic path and focussed on
            skill-based activities, identified his personal interests and
            groomed that interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Varun had an inclination for baking and
            doodling, they prioritized those skills, and today Varun is a
            successful entrepreneur who bakes and doodles.
            In 2014, when Varun launched his first brand “Varun’s Delight”, he
            created his own logo.He started getting orders for his baking gig,
            built his customer base purely out of his talent.Similarly, Varun’s
            doodling skills helped him to create his second brand “Varun’s
            Creation” where he sells products based on his designs and also
            takes on caricature gigs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              
              In every product of Varun, you can also
            away find a small note on Fragile X syndrome and building awareness
            about it.Neurodiversity has always been about embracing the diversity, the
            differences of each individual and their strengths
              While the
            majority of society is focused on the academics race in India, there
            are parents like Veena who are paving the way for change, helping
            other parents to understand what is important for their child and
            their personal growth.
