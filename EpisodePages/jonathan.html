            In our second episode of Global Dialogue Series on Neurodiversity, we speak with Jonathan Hassell. Jonathan is one of the world's top digital usability & accessibility thought leaders. He has over 19 years of experience in identifying new directions and challenges in digital accessibility. He has authored multiple international standards on accessibility and published the best-selling books 'Inclusive Design for Organisations' and 'Inclusive Design for Products'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jonathan founded ‘Hassell Inclusion’ in 2010, and leads a team of accessibility experts providing strategic accessibility transformation services to organisations worldwide. His mission is to help organisations embrace the business benefits of inclusive design and see their customers and staff who are differently-abled thrive as a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our conversation, Jonathan speaks about how companies should prioritize accessibility at the beginning of the product life-cycle rather than at the end which is much more time-consuming and expensive to fix. He also adds how accessibility enables different ways to use the app, even for people without disabilities and that companies have started to understand that if they get accessibility right, it’s good for their business too.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also interesting to learn from Jonathan, when Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) was first created, it was very much focused on people with physical disabilities, such as people who had difficulty in seeing or hearing and not so much on neurodiverse people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jonathan also highlights the growing shift in accessibility, and how the focus of accessibility is changing from customers to employees. He believes that it’s very crucial for organisations to be accessible at the workplace, as it will enable people to do their work efficiently and also attract more diverse talents. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Jonathan worked with the National Autistic Society (UK) to develop the missing guidelines in WCAG for neurodiverse individuals and they came up with 49 different guidelines. One of the key findings they observed was when an autistic individual visits a web page, the longer it took for them to find information the more anxious it made them. 
          </p>
          <p>
            What I really found interesting in this conversation is how much of the things we do for accessibility can benefit us beyond just making the website or app accessible. For example,   keeping the text simple, concise and clear on top of the webpage will not only help a neurodiverse individual but also help the website’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
          </p>
          <p>
            I asked Jonathan what is the best solution to create more accessible products? His simple answer was “make the team more inclusive”, by hiring neurodiverse individuals, individuals who are blind and having a diverse set of individuals involved in the process, will make the output automatically more inclusive.
          </p>
          <p>You find innovation from people who are very different from you. We have all benefited from innovation that was created to solve the problems for people with disabilities, whether it was inventing the typewriter for a blind Dutch countess or the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell to help someone hear better.</p>
