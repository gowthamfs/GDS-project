              In our second episode of Global Dialogue Series on Neurodiversity,
              we speak with Jonathan Hassell. Jonathan is one of the world's top
              digital usability & accessibility thought leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              He has over 19 years of experience in identifying new directions
              and challenges in digital accessibility.He has authored multiple
              international standards on accessibility and published.he
              best-selling books 'Inclusive Design for Organisations' and
              'Inclusive Design for Products'.

              <p>
                Jonathan founded ‘Hassell Inclusion’ in 2010, and leads a team of
              accessibility experts providing strategic accessibility
              transformation services to organisations worldwide.His mission is
                to help organisations embrace the business benefits of inclusive
                design and see their customers and staff who are differently-abled
                thrive as a result.</p>
                <p>
                  In our conversation, Jonathan speaks about how companies should
                prioritize accessibility at the beginning of the product
                life-cycle rather than at the end which is much more
                time-consuming and expensive to fix.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He also adds how accessibility enables different ways to use the
              app, even for people without disabilities and that companies have
              started to understand that if they get accessibility right,it’s
              good for their business too.
                </p>
                
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            
            <p>
              It’s also interesting to learn from Jonathan, when Web Content
              Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) was first created, it was very
              much focused on people with physical disabilities, such as people
              who had difficulty in seeing or hearing and not so much on
              neurodiverse people.
            </p>
            <p>
              He explains how most of the needs of neurodiverse people were not
              reflected in the guidelines since it was quite complex.As Autism
              is a range of spectrum and not everyone who is autistic
              experiences Autism the same way.
            </p>
            
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
           
            <p>
              Jonathan also highlights the
              growing shift in accessibility, and how the focus of accessibility
              is changing from customers to employees.He believes that it’s very crucial for organisations to be
              accessible at the workplace, as it will enable people to do their
              work efficiently and also attract more diverse talents.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is especially true for neurodiverse individuals, where even
              the simplest changes can help boost their productivity
              drastically.
            </p>
            <p>
              
              Jonathan worked with the National Autistic Society (UK) to develop
              the missing guidelines in WCAG for neurodiverse individuals and
              they came up with 49 different guidelines.One of the key findings they observed was when an autistic
              individual visits a web page.
            </p>
            
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            
            <p>
              
              What I really found interesting in
              this conversation is how much of the things we do for
              accessibility can benefit us beyond just making the website or app
              accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, keeping the text simple, concise and clear on top of
              the webpage will not only help a neurodiverse individual but also
              help the website’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO).Jonathan
              tells how the future of accessibility is personalisation and all
              about enabling users to choose what they want.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div class="wrapper">
              <p>
                We can implement a universal design concept for blind users as
                they are listening to the page and not seeing it, so the changes
                to the core website does not get affected much but that’s not the
                case for neurodiverse individuals where each individual has their
                own preferences that can completely change the outlay of the
                website.
              </p>
              <p>
                To handle the difference of opinions, you have to go by
              personalisation and not go by one size fits all approach. I asked
              Jonathan what is the best solution to create more accessible
              products? 
              </p>
              <p>
                His simple answer was “make the team more inclusive”, by
                  hiring neurodiverse individuals, individuals who are blind and
                  having a diverse set of individuals involved in the process, will
                  make the output automatically more inclusive.

                We have all benefited from innovation that was created to solve
                the problems for people with disabilities, whether it was
                inventing the typewriter for a blind Dutch countess or the
                telephone by Alexander Graham Bell to help someone hear better.
