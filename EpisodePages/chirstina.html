            In our fourth episode of Global Dialogue Series on Neurodiversity,
            we speak with Christina Ryan, the CEO and Founder of the Disability
            Leadership Institute. Christina has been an active leader in the
            Australian disability community for over 20 years, working at an
            international, national and local level to change the diversity
            agenda, while mentoring and supporting numerous people with
            disabilities to achieve their own leadership success. Christina
            established the Disability Leadership Institute in 2016 as a
            professional hub to build & support leaders with disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christina pioneered the use of mainstream forums by women with
            disabilities at the United Nations, and now mentors and teaches
            effective use of the UN for rights activists globally, while working
            as a leadership coach for people with disabilities. Many
            organizations have not given a thought about how disabilities and
            leadership can actually go together. Christina tells us it’s either
            because they think people with disabilities can't do leadership or
            they are not noticing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her years of experience, she observed that not many people talk
            about their disabilities in the workplace. The main reason for this
            is that it can stop one’s career or promotion. She has seen that
            opening up about their disability has been a risky thing to do. The
            more senior level they are in, the greater the risk. They are the
            ones at the most risk of losing their job if they speak about their
            differences, be encouraged to look for new jobs or pushed to the
            sidelines and never given any opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a certain level up to which people with disabilities get a
            job but beyond that, there’s no further growth. We seem to be
            trapped into thinking that disability is something that happens in
            the lower job positions and not in leadership positions. Many
            internal leadership programs focus on women, people from different
            cultures but never talk or recognize disabilities as part of their
            leadership program and that should be the first step to shift their
            mindsets to start thinking about disabilities in the context of
            leadership as part of their diversity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christina tells us that the best way to solve this is for people to
            understand their differences, use it as an asset in their workplace,
            which will make it easy for them to be open about how they think or
            operate. To develop neurodiverse leadership, organizations need to
            give flexibility for individuals to talk about what they are good at
            and equally about what they are not good at. They should be able to
            delegate the work they struggle with to someone who is good at that
            task without any repercussions and truly embrace people’s
            differences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations should think about what diversity really means to
            them, understand how diversity is contributing, how everyone is not
            the same and celebrate those differences. We need diverse approaches
            and diverse thoughts, not just in the workforce but in leadership
            too. We need all those different people shaping the way the modern
            workforce will look into the future, so we can grow diversity and
            have different decision makers at the top of the organization.

            Christina shares how people with disabilities spend a lot of time
            just on the edges. It’s quite understandable that they will always
            be conscious about how they are not included or a part of the group.
            It's a difficult task for them to change the culture inside the room
            when they are the ones outside of it. People should not feel
            responsible for making their differences be ok, or try to make other
            people comfortable by hiding their disabilities so it’s less
            confronting.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should be the people who matter in the organization, people with
            the power, people with the resources, coming to them and asking what
            they need, what it should look like, rather than expecting people
            with disabilities to change the system from outside. When an
            organization supports their staff with disabilities to do leadership
            development, it changes a few things. It changes how the
            organization looks at that person, how the person operates and makes
            them more comfortable with themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Role models are very important. When you have a person with a
            disability in a senior position, all those entry-level employees can
            see the potential of their growth in the company and also see that
            it’s acceptable to be different. It’s very isolating when you’re the
            only person in the entire branch or department who has a disability.
            This is still a very common experience but it’s gradually shifting.
            We start to see a shift when people with disabilities become
            recognized and celebrated within the organizations
          </p>
          <p>
            When people are being themselves, they work better, they are not
            trying to work on something that drains their energy or pretending
            to be someone else. Leaders and senior executives should look around
            themselves and ask if their leadership team is diverse and
            represents all individuals across gender, race, disability &
            cognitive abilities, if they can’t see anyone they should ask why
            not and what they are doing to make it change.
