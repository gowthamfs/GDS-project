            Imagine someone from a faraway land who speaks a different language
            and has a different culture than yours comes to your country and
            tries to learn your language and your culture. Would you appreciate
            that person for trying to adapt or demean them that they are not
            capable? Our guest today, Yenn Purkis tells us how they view autism
            as a cultural difference and people from the land of Autism
            communicate and work differently and that there are more ways than
            one to communicate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest challenge according to them is to educate neurotypical
            people that their language, even though different, is equally valid.
            When we start looking at autism as a cultural difference, we start
            looking at it in a more positive light. We understand that there are
            differences in approach and accept that there are different ways of
            thinking, and thus, truly embrace neurodiversity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yenn Purkis is an autistic and non-binary author, public speaker and
            community leader from Australia who also has a diagnosis of
            schizophrenia. Yenn works in the autism / neurodiversity, gender
            diversity and mental health advocacy spaces. Yenn is the author of
            ten published books on elements of autism and is a regular blogger.
            They were named the 2016 ACT Volunteer of the Year and received the
            ACT Chief Minister’s Inclusion Award for Achievement in Inclusion in
            2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yenn is also a prolific public speaker and has presented at a range
            of events including TEDx Canberra in 2013. One of the things that
            I’m really amazed about Yenn, is their resilience and motivation to
            make a positive change in life, no matter how difficult the journey
            is. Yenn had an extremely hard life when they were a young adult,
            having schizophrenia, generalized anxiety disorder and depression
            making life very arduous, but that didn’t stop them.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the age of 25, Yenn realized that they had to change their life
            and set out on this amazing journey from being unemployable to
            having a career as a public servant in government administration and
            publishing ten books. As Yenn shares, they are a very ethical person
            with a very unethical history and that has pushed and motivated them
            to make a difference not just in their life but also in the lives of
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2005, Yenn wrote their first autobiography titled “Finding a
            Different Kind of Normal” thanks to the motivation from Polly
            Samuel, who is also known as Donna Williams. Polly is one of the
            first autistic people in the world to write an autobiography. While
            Yenn was reluctant to write about their life story initially, it was
            Polly who helped them to change their mind. Polly told Yenn how when
            she gives talks to parents, there are always a few parents at the
            back of the room, who sit there and leave before the talk ends.

            Those are the parents of autistic kids who are in trouble with the
            law and are ashamed to talk about their children. If Yenn wrote
            their autobiography, it would be for those parents. This made Yenn
            think about their own parents and their experiences and set out to
            write their first book. Yenn did not advocate much until 2012, when
            they met a young autistic man who refused to believe Yenn’s life
            story was true. He could not believe it because till then, every
            conversation he had around autism was all about what he couldn’t do
            or his lack of capabilities, that he needed a lot of support and
            couldn’t live independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Yenn realized that there were many more autistic
            individuals like this young man, who were always reminded about what
            they cannot do. According to Yenn, the diagnosis of autism should
            lead to positive things like getting the right support, being
            empowered and becoming proud of who you are. This catapulted Yenn to
            the world of advocacy and inspired them to write their second book
            to help autistic teenagers prepare for the workforce.
            Since Yenn’s diagnosis of autism in 1994, there has been a paradigm
            shift in the community, from how parents embrace autism, how the
            general population has become more aware and educated about autism,
            to young neurodivergent kids, teenagers and adults achieving amazing
            things and advocating for themselves. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Yenn advises young
            neurodivergent adults that while the journey might be hard, it does
            get better, not incrementally better, but with some ups and downs.
            As you get older and the more aware you become of who you are, how
            you communicate, how you fit in the world and who you want to be,
            life does get better.
             In Yenn’s life, the pivotal moment was when
            they realized that they were in charge of what happened in their
            life, that they were in the driver’s seat and it was up to them to
            make the change. Within eight years, Yenn achieved all the goals
            they set out to do.
