              In our first episode of Global Dialogue<br> Series on Neurodiversity,
                we speak with<br> Antoni Bohdanowicz, who was diagnosed<br> with
                Asperger’s Syndrome at the age 16.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since 2013, Antoni has been
                working as a journalist and is one of the leading voices of Autism
                advocacy in Poland.
              In 2019, Antoni joined BP in their Budapest office and is actively
                involved in various initiatives to nurture Neurodiversity within
                the company.Outside of BP, Antoni is helping to build
                ‘Neurodiversity in Business’, a forum for corporates to share
                their knowledge and experience in creating neuro-inclusive
                workspaces.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              Antoni talks about the struggles he faced throughout his
              education, how it can be difficult for neurodiverse individuals
              when the system is not inclusive or adaptive to individual needs
              and how while he struggled in group classes, he excelled with
              individual tutoring.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              Antoni highlights a really interesting point of how we should
              implement an education system that focuses on creating a
              personalized learning environment that can foster one's strengths
              and interests.
              
            </p>
            <p>
              which I too personally believe is very important, especially for
              neurodiverse individuals. 
              We have seen with so many of our own
              students at HashHackCode. 
              
              
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            <p>
              when we build the student’s
              interest, their confidence is boosted and we are then able to
              impart more advanced learning.A major struggle for many neurodiverse individuals is the job
              interview process.There are various reasons for this. Antoni
              shares a few of his own struggles of how the concept of an
              interview can build anxiety and how this can be tackled by
              providing the individuals the interview questions beforehand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Antonie also shares his thoughts on how we should hire beyond a
              university degree as many neurodiverse individuals are not able to
              attend university as it is not accessible to them.
              What’s interesting in all of this is how Antoni shares that this
              process should be open for everyone and not just neurodiverse
              individuals or a segment of people, only then can we bring in true
              inclusion.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper">
            
            <p>
              He also states that we should hire the best candidate for the role
              and not hire for the sake of diversity hiring, as they won't be
              able to grow in their job with meaningful sense in future.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the episode, we also talk about the importance of the
              managers & team leaders, how they should understand that working
              processes are different for different people and have regular
              reviews to see what they are going through.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can radically
              help reduce meltdowns. Showing empathy will not only help others
              but will also increase the productivity and innovation of the
              company.Initiatives are important to help diversity. Knowledge should be
              open so that awareness can build for all and have a global
              implementation model.

               That's exactly what Antoni & co are working
              towards with “Neurodiversity in Business”, an open forum where
              experts are sharing their model and leading the way for all
              businesses to become more inclusive and understanding for
              neurodiverse individuals.
