            In our first episode of Global Dialogue Series on Neurodiversity, we
            speak with Antoni Bohdanowicz, who was diagnosed with Asperger’s
            Syndrome at the age 16. Since 2013, Antoni has been working as a
            journalist and is one of the leading voices of Autism advocacy in
            Poland.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, Antoni joined BP in their Budapest office and is actively
            involved in various initiatives to nurture Neurodiversity within the
            company. Outside of BP, Antoni is helping to build ‘Neurodiversity
            in Business’, a forum for corporates to share their knowledge and
            experience in creating neuro-inclusive workspaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Antoni talks about the struggles he faced throughout his education,
            how it can be difficult for neurodiverse individuals when the system
            is not inclusive or adaptive to individual needs and how while he
            struggled in group classes, he excelled with individual tutoring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Antoni highlights a really interesting point of how we should
            implement an education system that focuses on creating a
            personalized learning environment that can foster one's strengths
            and interests, which I too personally believe is very important,
            especially for neurodiverse individuals. We have seen with so many
            of our own students at HashHackCode, that when we build the
            student’s interest, their confidence is boosted and we are then able
            to impart more advanced learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            A major struggle for many neurodiverse individuals is the job
            interview process. There are various reasons for this. Antoni shares
            a few of his own struggles of how the concept of an interview can
            build anxiety and how this can be tackled by providing the
            individuals the interview questions beforehand. Antonie also shares
            his thoughts on how we should hire beyond a university degree as
            many neurodiverse individuals are not able to attend university as
            it is not accessible to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            What’s interesting in all of this is how Antoni shares that this
            process should be open for everyone and not just neurodiverse
            individuals or a segment of people, only then can we bring in true
            inclusion. He also states that we should hire the best candidate for
            the role and not hire for the sake of diversity hiring, as they
            won't be able to grow in their job with meaningful sense in future.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the episode, we also talk about the importance of the
            managers & team leaders, how they should understand that working
            processes are different for different people and have regular
            reviews to see what they are going through. This can radically help
            reduce meltdowns. Showing empathy will not only help others but will
            also increase the productivity and innovation of the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initiatives are important to help diversity. Knowledge should be
            open so that awareness can build for all and have a global
            implementation model. That's exactly what Antoni & co are working
            towards with “Neurodiversity in Business”, an open forum where
            experts are sharing their model and leading the way for all
            businesses to become more inclusive and understanding for
            neurodiverse individuals.
